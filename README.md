# Predicting-Uber-Fare-Amounts-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
### Problem Statement

#### Title: Predicting Uber Fare Amounts Using Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Background:
The transportation industry has seen a significant shift with the advent of ride-sharing services like Uber. Predicting the fare amount for a given trip based on various factors such as distance, time of day, and location can help improve customer satisfaction, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance operational efficiency. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to accurately predict Uber fare amounts using historical trip data.

#### Objectives:
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
   - Understand the structure and characteristics of the Uber dataset.
   - Preprocess the data to handle missing values, convert data types, and create new features for analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create meaningful features such as the distance covered per trip using geographical coordinates.
   - Extract temporal features like the day of the week and hour of the day from the pickup datetime.

3. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
   - Apply various machine learning algorithms to predict the fare amount.
   - Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Compare the models to identify the best-performing algorithm.

4. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Identify instances where the fare per mile is unusually high or low.
   - Analyze these outliers to understand the underlying reasons and ensure data quality.

#### Data:
The dataset includes historical Uber trip data with the following key attributes:
- `pickup_datetime`: The date and time when the trip started.
- `pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`: The geographical coordinates of the pickup location.
- `dropoff_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude`: The geographical coordinates of the dropoff location.
- `fare_amount`: The fare charged for the trip.
- `passenger_count`: The number of passengers in the trip.
- `Airports`: The airport associated with the trip, if any.

#### Expected Outcomes:
- Accurate prediction models for Uber fare amounts.
- Insights into factors influencing fare variability.
- Identification of outliers and potential reasons behind them.

Conclusion
The Random Forest model's ability to handle non-linear relationships, feature interactions, and outliers, combined with its robustness and minimal need for preprocessing, likely contributed to its superior performance in predicting Uber fares. This ensemble method's strengths align well with the characteristics of the dataset, making it the best-performing model in this scenario.
